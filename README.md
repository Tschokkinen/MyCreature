The idea of MyCreature is based on Tamagochi: you feed and care for your creature, if you don't they become unhappy.

The main goal of the project has been to get to know C++ works and how to use pointers efficiently.

If you don't have Boost (required to build the program), <b>you can instead download a compiled version MyCreature.exe</b>.<br><br>
To load and existing creature pass your creature name as an argument when loading the program: "MyCreature.exe MyCreatureNameHere" or alternatively name can be given after launching the program.
